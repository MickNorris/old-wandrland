# Wandr.Land
This is one of my favorite and most ambitious projects to date. Wandr.Land (pronounced Wanderland) was a Pokemon Go-esque game where I hid QR codes all across my college campus. When someone finds one of the codes, they would be taken to wandr.land where they are told they've won X amount of points for finding this code. From there it is explained that there are codes hidden all over campus and if they want to be on the global leaderboard on the main page, they should look to find as many codes as they can. To add more competition I added a "rarity" mechanic where each code was given a multiplier that corresponded to how many times the code had been scanned. This was to encourage players to look for codes in places where most people wouldn't look.

# How was it received?
At the very least, everyone I personally talked to about the app liked the idea. Watching on the backend I could see that roughly 5 codes were being scanned per day. Usually 3 - 4/5 were new scans, but the rest were scans of people who had already previously scanned a code, so I'd say there was at least some interest in the app. 

# How was it made?
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI/UX.
 - [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - run cloud functions and cron jobs.
 - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - building the site from this github repo (for free).


# How can I play?

Unforunately you probably won't be able to find a code, but you can visit the site here (explor.netlify.com) or scan this QR code:
